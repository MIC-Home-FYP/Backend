Jack is currently recovering from dengue fever and requires close monitoring and supportive care. His treatment will focus on symptom management, hydration, and prevention of complications. Jack should maintain strict bed rest, especially while his platelet count is below 50,000/mm. He must drink plenty of fluids, including water, isotonic drinks, fruit juices, and soup, to prevent dehydration. If oral intake is insufficient, intravenous fluid administration may be necessary.
For fever and pain management, Jack should take paracetamol as needed, avoiding aspirin and ibuprofen due to the risk of bleeding complications. His vital signs, particularly body temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate, should be monitored and recorded daily. Jack's platelet count and hematocrit levels must be checked daily, especially when his platelets drop below 100,000/mm. We will conduct regular blood tests to assess his kidney and liver function, as well as to monitor his white blood cell count.
Jack should be vigilant for warning signs of severe dengue, such as severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, or blood in vomit. If any of these symptoms occur, he should seek immediate medical attention. As Jack recovers, we will gradually increase his activity level, but he should avoid strenuous exercise until fully recovered.
To prevent mosquito bites and reduce the risk of transmission, Jack should use mosquito repellents and wear protective clothing. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor his progress and ensure a full recovery. With proper care and monitoring, most patients recover from dengue fever within 2 to 7 days. Jack's recovery will be closely tracked, and his care plan adjusted as needed based on his symptoms and test results.
